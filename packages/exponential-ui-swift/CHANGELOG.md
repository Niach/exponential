# Changelog: `ExponentialUI` (SwiftUI)

All notable changes to this package. The SDK packages share one version and
release together from a `ui-v<version>` tag (`packages/exponential-ui/release/README.md`).

## 0.1.0 (unreleased)

First release.

- `ExponentialUI`: `SurfaceModel` + `ExponentialSurface` paint an A2UI surface at the frames the Rust core computes, on iOS 17+ and macOS 14+. It measures text in batches with TextKit/CoreText.
- `ExponentialUIPrimitives`: generic SwiftUI primitives themed by `PrimitiveTokens`. Pure SwiftUI, no binary.
- `ExponentialUIFFI.xcframework`: device arm64, simulator arm64 + x86_64, macOS arm64 + x86_64, profile `mobile`.
- Host-owned text fields take the Input `type`'s keyboard, autofill content type and autocorrection. Platform sliders keep the author's range; they take the step only when it divides the range (otherwise the value snaps and still reaches `max`), and are continuous when `step` is 0.
- An extension the core refuses throws: at `ExponentialUI.register`, and when a `SurfaceModel` is created.
- Video and AudioPlayer play their `src` through the media request (AVKit's player for Video; play / pause, a seekable track and the elapsed time for AudioPlayer). An http(s) `src` streams with the request's headers, any size; a policed probe resolves its redirects first. A `data:` `src` plays from a temporary file: at most 8 are kept, each is deleted when no player holds it, and the directory is emptied once per process. A second press while a source opens waits for it. A denied `src` loads nothing, and the controls stay inert.
- Every redirect hop of a media load passes the media policy again: schemes, hosts, no https→http downgrade, and only the headers of the rules the new url matches.
- A failed painter is reported once per component and is not painted again until its props change.
- Markdown link parsing is linear on hostile input, and links nest at most 32 deep.
- Unnamed media fall back to the platform's localized image trait, not to English text.
- Conformance, real-font geometry and fixture replay suites run on macOS (`swift test`) and on the iOS Simulator (`xcodebuild test`).

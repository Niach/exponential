# GitHub Actions

Two workflows publish ghcr images on every push to `master` and on
`v*.*.*` / `v*.*.*-dev` tags — the distribution channel for both the cloud
and self-hosting:

- `build-web.yml` → `ghcr.io/niach/exponential-web` (root `Dockerfile`,
  multi-arch amd64 + arm64 via native runners + a digest-merge job)
- `build-steer-relay.yml` → `ghcr.io/niach/exponential-steer-relay`
  (`Dockerfile.steer-relay`, multi-arch via QEMU)

Tag scheme (both images): `latest` + `master` + `sha-<short>` on master
pushes, semver (`0.18.21` / `0.18`) on tag pushes. `latest` moves on every
master push — self-hosters pin semver (`selfhost/docker-compose.yaml` +
`INSTALL.md`). Both ghcr packages must stay **public** so anonymous
`docker pull` works.

The cloud at https://app.exponential.at runs a Coolify dockerimage app that
pulls the web image; the steer relays (steer.exponential.at /
steer-next.exponential.at) pull the relay image the same way. Coolify's
control plane is home-LAN-only, so **there is no auto-redeploy webhook**.
After a green Actions run, deploy manually from a LAN-connected machine:

```
coolify deploy uuid <app-uuid>
```

Or click "Deploy" in the Coolify UI.

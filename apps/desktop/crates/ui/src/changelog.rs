//! The in-app changelog (EXP-723) — the desktop half of EXP-164's "What's
//! new".
//!
//! The web app keeps the whole history in `apps/web/src/lib/changelog.ts` and
//! surfaces the HEAD entry as a dismissable card in its sidebar footer. The
//! desktop shows the same card in the rail footer, so it needs the same head
//! entry — mirrored here as a const rather than fetched, because the app must
//! be able to say what is new in the build the user is actually running (an
//! older desktop pinned to an older release must not advertise a newer web
//! entry).
//!
//! **The mirror is a contract**: [`LATEST`] is a verbatim copy of
//! `CHANGELOG[0]` — id, date, title, summary and body — and
//! `apps/web/src/lib/changelog-desktop-mirror.test.ts` reads this file and
//! fails the web suite when the ids or titles drift. Prepending a web entry
//! means updating this const in the same commit.
//!
//! Dismissal state is the per-install `settings.json` key `changelogSeenId`
//! (the desktop analog of the web's per-device `changelog-seen.ts`): the card
//! renders while the stored id differs from [`LATEST`]'s, and both the ✕ and
//! opening the dialog store it.

- **Unchanged lines on request**: the gap above and between changes says how many lines it hides, and opens them where you want to read around an edit.
- **Renames, copies and binaries**: a renamed or copied file names where it came from, and a binary file says so instead of showing an empty body.
- **Cut output is marked**: when a run's tool output or diff is too long to send whole, the transcript says how many lines were dropped rather than ending mid line."#,

    body: r#"- **One screen, three faces**: an issue, its coding run and the run's changes are one screen now. The header never jumps, and the bottom-right circle switches between the faces; with several places to go it opens a menu above itself, with several runs of yours one row per run.
- **Stop and Resume up top**: while you look at the run, Stop (or Resume once it ended) sits in the top-right corner, where the old Watch button and the usage menu used to be.
- **The composer matches the desktop**: the run's reply box shows the plan-mode word, the attach button, the model picker and a small usage ring that opens the usage sheet.
- **Changes as a page**: the run's diff, or the issue's open pull request, is a full page with the GitHub link and Merge PR in the bar, instead of a floating bar over the transcript.
- **Simpler session lists**: the Agent page's rows no longer carry Merge and open-issue buttons on any client; tapping a row opens the run."#,
